Note: I was recently asked if this code could be used in their own project. The answer is a resounding yes. This is open source. The Iron Infantry Branding however should not be in your finished project. i.e. Create your own logos!

IMPORTANT: YOU NEED ALL THREE FILES to PLAY! All Zips need to be opened, and the IronInfantry Directories in each need to be combined. See Diagram Below of the DIR STRUCTURE.

Helicopters, Soldiers, Tanks (so far) 3D and First Person Perspectives. Have fun! Make sure to read the README file - there are a lot of keypresses!

Development for DarkBasic Professional Version has ceased - hence this demo and source code release. Currently, the development is in DarkGDK, and the source code that's been put together so far is available in the Jegas Game Classes v3.0 which is a product in its own right... but also the ground work for Iron Infantry! :)

Google was nice enough to host this - but I had to split the project into three files to fit it.

Dir Structure should be(Ignore question marks google may throw in):

-----IronInfantry   (Source and EXE)

----------tmedia

---------------Animations

---------------Apache

---------------Audio

---------------Logo

---------------Ranger

---------------SkyBox

---------------Sprite

---------------Tank

---------------USA

---------------Water
