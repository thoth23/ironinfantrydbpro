#summary - Game Work In Progress

= Introduction =

This demo is a snapshot in time of *Iron Infantry's* progress before I switched to a different game engine (Same Vendor): DarkGDK C++.

= Details =

In short Iron Infantry is still in development. See http://www.jasonpetersage.com/ and follow the menu for game developement. There you'll find a progress log I update when I can and a progress photo gallery of various stages of development along the way.

Have Fun!
